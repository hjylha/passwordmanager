At this point only test.py works, so
`python test.py`

### Libraries/modules used:
* cryptography
* pyperclip
* base64
* getpass
* sqlite3
* os


### Possible improvements
* It would be better to have things set up in such a way that it is not necessary for the master password to be decrypted
* Replacing 'input' with something else
* Everyone wants a fancy GUI...
